                  Dig a hole outside, feel the soil. It's colder than the air temperature. Is the soil dense?
                  Is the soil loose? Wet? Dry? Rocky? Sandy? Already, you've learned something about your little patch of dirt.

               <p>Certain plants and microorganisms thrive in certain kinds of soil or climates. These particular locations have names. They are called <b>Planting zones</b> or <b>Plant Hardiness Zones</b>.

               I happen to be in central eastern Missouri at the moment. We are Zone: 6a-6b

               The soil in my backyard is all clay all the time. I'm sure I could make some cool pottery out of it.

               <p>
               However, there are other types. Yours may be different, it most likely is. Soil types can change from one yard to another. Typically, though, where I am, it's clay.

               From here, you will assess the amount of water the site gets and how your particular soil handles water. Is it in a depression? On a slope? <br>
               Some plants like water logged roots, while others prefer an occassional drizzle. </br>
               <br>My back yard is mostly sloped, meaning anything I plant there, needs to able to deal with drought,
               as the rain water will quickly flow down the hill before soaking into the soil.</br>

               So now we know we have clay soil, on a slope, receiving little water.<br>
               How much sun does it get?</br> 
               <br>My backyard slope faces north. It is partially shaded in the evening by a humungous sycamore. But gets blasted by sun in the morning and afternoon.

            Luckily for us, most seed packages and plant tags have the plant's watering and sun needs printed directly on to it for our edification.
            <br>With our brain full of information, and hopefully, a few notes taken. We know we are looking for something that can thrive in dry, clay soil, with a blast of sun in the afternoon.</br>
